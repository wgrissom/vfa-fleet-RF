In variable flip angle (VFA) FLEET acquisitions, 
interleaved segments of EPI readouts are acquired consecutively, 
with no delay between them. 
This reduces the likelihood of phase shifts and motion between segments which otherwise 
cause ghosting and motion artifacts in conventional segmented acquisitions. 
Because of the short recovery times between RF pulses in VFA-FLEET,
there is negligible time for longitudinal relaxation, 
and the longitudinal magnetization available immediately before each RF pulse is a function of both 
the previous RF pulse's rotation parameters
and the longitudinal magnetization available immediately before the previous RF pulse.
Thus, the longitudinal magnetization profile changes between excitations and must be accounted for in the RF pulse design in order
to maintain a consistent transverse magnetization (signal) profile across the imaged slice. 
In this document, I describe a strategy to recursively design slice-selective RF pulses for FLEET acquisitions using the Shinnar-Le Roux (SLR) algorithm.

\par There are two boundary conditions for this problem. 
Because longitudinal magnetization is replenished during the long delay between the last segment of one acquisition and the first segment of the next, 
we assume $M_z = 1$ before the first pulse, 
and the last pulse should have a 90-degree flip angle to maximize signal by completely depleting the remaining longitudinal magnetization.
Since the longitudinal magnetization before the last pulse is unknown, 
we must start by designing the first pulse.
However, designing this pulse requires knowledge of its nominal passband flip angle,
which can be calculated recursively starting with the last flip angle as:
\begin{equation}
\theta_{i-1} = \tan^{-1} \sin \theta_i,
\end{equation}
where $i$ indexes segments.
Given the first pulse's flip angle, the conventional SLR algorithm can be used to calculate the first pulse. 
That pulse will have rotation parameters $A_1$ and $B_1$, which are functions of frequency.
Given those parameters, the longitudinal magnetization before the second segment's pulse is:
\begin{equation}
M_z^{i+1} = M_z^i \left( 1 - 2 \vert B_i \vert^2\right). 
\end{equation}
To solve for the second segment's pulse, 
we need its complex-valued $B$ profile. 
First we solve for its magnitude, 
using the fact that the magnitude of the transverse magnetization it excites should be the same as the first pulse's magnitude,
as:
\begin{equation}
\vert M_{xy}^1 \vert = \vert M_{xy}^{i+1} \vert =  \vert M_z^{i+1} 2 A^*_{i+1} B_{i+1} \vert = \vert M_z^{i+1} \vert 2 \sqrt{1 - \vert B_{i+1} \vert^2} \vert B_{i+1} \vert,
\end{equation}
where the last equality results from the fact that $\vert A \vert^2 + \vert B \vert^2 = 1$.
This equation is quadratic in $\vert B_{i+1} \vert^2$, so the quadratic equation can be applied to solve for $\vert B_{i+1} \vert$.
Then the complex-valued $A_{i+1}$ can be solved by assuming a min-power pulse [Pauly SLR],
and the phase of $B_{i+1}$ can be obtained from $A_{i+1}$ and $M_{xy}^1$ as:
\begin{equation}
\angle B_{i+1} = \angle \left(\frac{M_{xy}^1}{M_z^{i+1} 2 A_{i+1}^* }\right).
\end{equation}
Then the RF pulse for segment $i+1$ can be calculated from the complex-valued $A$ and $B$ profiles using the inverse SLR transform.
